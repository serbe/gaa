            understood as digital assets that exist on the blockchain. Once they are brought onto
            the blockchain, they can never be removed and you are able to see every person that has
            ever owned that NFT as all sales are stored on the blockchain. NFTs can be in the form
            of digital art, music, virtual real estate, all the way through to collectibles and
            gaming assets! Any digital asset can be minted or tokenized and turned into an NFT. Once
            minted or tokenized, these assets can be bought, sold and traded using cryptocurrency.

            decentralized (i.e. not controlled by one person, company, or entity) and it is a ledger
            of transactions. It‚Äôs a way of keeping track of all transactions that occur within the
            blockchain, and there are also protocols set up to validate these transactions. That way
            you know that what you‚Äôre buying, sending, or receiving is authentic. Nothing can be
            changed on the blockchain!
